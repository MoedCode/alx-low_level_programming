Absolutely! There are several online platforms that allow you to visualize your code execution. Here are a few you might find useful:

1. **Python Tutor** - [pythontutor.com](http://www.pythontutor.com/)

   Despite its name, Python Tutor supports not only Python, but also Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, Ruby, C, and C++. This tool gives you step-by-step visualizations of code execution, which can be extremely helpful for understanding how code works, especially for beginners.

2. **VisuAlgo** - [visualgo.net](https://visualgo.net/en)

   VisuAlgo is an online platform to visualize data structures and algorithms. While it doesn't visualize arbitrary code, it's extremely useful for understanding data structures like lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs, as well as algorithms like sorting, DFS, BFS, shortest path, etc.

3. **Algorithm Visualizer** - [algorithm-visualizer.org](https://algorithm-visualizer.org/)

   This is another great tool for visualizing algorithms. It allows you to choose an algorithm, understand it in theory, and then visualize the steps of the algorithm.

4. **JS Tutor** - [jstutor.cs50.io](https://jstutor.cs50.io/)

   JS Tutor, developed by Harvard's CS50 team, is a tool for visualizing JavaScript code execution, similar to Python Tutor.

5. **Online Python Tutor** - [opt-live.com](https://opt-live.com/)

   This is a real-time version of Online Python Tutor, which allows you to step forward and backward through your code.

Please note that while these tools are extremely helpful, they might not support all programming languages or all features of a language. They are best used for educational purposes and to help understand how a piece of code or algorithm works.
